Installing Git


###################################################################################################################
Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.
Note
	

This book was written using Git version 2.0.0. Though most of the commands we use should work even in ancient versions of Git, some of them might not or might act slightly differently if you’re using an older version. Since Git is quite excellent at preserving backwards compatibility, any version after 2.0 should work just fine.
Installing on Linux

If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora for example (or any closely-related RPM-based distro such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
####################################################################################################################

$ sudo dnf install git-all

If you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:

this is prakash.........
git push origin <branch>

This “pushes” the changes you made to a specified branch to the remote repository. Once we’ve done this, your team members can “pull” and see your changes.

git push origin master

At this point, if git gets angry and roars a bunch of nonsense at you, make sure you are a contributor (or the owner) on the project in order to contribute directly. The other option is to fork the project to your own account, and submit pull requests when you want your buddies to pull your changes. It’s a neat process for contributing to open source projects, but it’s not necessary for a group of friends.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ sudo apt-get install git-all

For more options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix flavors on the Git website, at http://git-scm.com/download/linux.
Installing on Mac

There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at http://git-scm.com/download/mac.
